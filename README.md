You could also add some **GitHub stats or languages chart** to make it visually appealing. For example:

```md
![Ehtisham's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ehtisham-b29&show_icons=true&theme=radical)
```

If you want, I can also create a **more playful, personality-driven version** that makes your GitHub profile stand out and attract collaborators.

Do you want me to do that next?
